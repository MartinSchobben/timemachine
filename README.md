# Introduction to the timemachine app

This app is intended for educational purposes. The interactive plots
should instill a better appreciation of long geological timescales and
our current understanding of past, present and future climate. The
current rate of climate change is unprecedented when compared to what we
know of past climate and extreme climate events, such as the
Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; \~56 Ma).

I am still developing the app.

# Data sources and compilation

The surface temperature record spanning the Cretaceous up to the
Holocene is based on the corrected
![\\delta](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=%5Cdelta
"\\delta")<sup>18</sup>O dataset of Westerhold et al. (2020), and
following the same corrections for the presence of ice as described in
Hansen et al. (2013). The Holocene temperatures are based on the global
temperature anomaly (Standard<sub>5x5Grid</sub>) stack of Marcott et al.
(2013) spliced on top of a 1961–1990 mean temperature of
14![\\,](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=%5C%2C "\\,")°C
(Hansen et al. 2013). The instrumental HadCrut4 sea surface anomaly
dataset was downloaded from the Climatic Research Unit (University of
East Anglia) and Met Office
[website](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadSST3-gl.dat).
This record was spliced on top of the mean temperature of the Marcott et
al. (2013) record for the interval between 1961 and 1990. Future
extrapolations (scenarios or Representative Concentration Pathways) are
based on the General Circulation Model data generated by the BCC\_CM1
model, which was downloaded from the
[Climate4impact](https://climate4impact.eu/) website. The composite
dataset of the app can be recompiled by running the scripts contained in
the data-raw directory. The function `read_instrum_data()` will generate
a global average value for the instrumental HadCrut4 data, see also the
website above for the same code. The script `reduce_clim_model.R` can be
used to flatten the array of time-incremented model data spanning up
2100.

# Basic usage of the R package

## Installation

You can install the released version of timemachine and run the app from
your local console.

``` r
# Install timemachine from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MartinSchobben/timemachine")
```

## Usage

Load point with `library`.

``` r
library(timemachine)
```

## Run the app

Start the app by running.

``` r
timemachine_app()
```

# Credits

The *timemachine* app is created with
*shiny*(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="shiny">**???**</span>)
in the R language(R Core Team 2020). The package and app rely on a set
of external packages from the tidyverse universe, including: *dplyr*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="dplyr">**???**</span>),
*tidyr*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="tidyr">**???**</span>),
*tibble*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="tibble">**???**</span>),
*ggplot2*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="ggplot2">**???**</span>),
*rlang*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rlang">**???**</span>).
Package development is aided by; *devtools*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="devtools">**???**</span>),
*roxygen2*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="roxygen2">**???**</span>),
*testthat*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="testthat">**???**</span>).
This README file is generated with *knitr*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="knitr1">**???**</span>
;
<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="knitr2">**???**</span>),
*rmarkdown*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rmarkdown1">**???**</span>;
<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="rmarkdown2">**???**</span>).
The graphics for the chronostratigraphic plots use the packages;
*gridExtra*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="gridExtra">**???**</span>),
*gtable*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="gtable">**???**</span>),
and *Cairo*
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Cairo">**???**</span>).

The book: *Mastering Shiny*, by Wickham (2020) greatly helped
development of the app.
